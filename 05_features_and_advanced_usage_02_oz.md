## Sandboxing applications with Subgraph Oz

Subgraph OS runs desktop applications inside of our security sandbox (**Oz**). 
The security sandbox is an additional layer of security, above and beyond the 
othersecurity features of Subgraph OS. Subgraph OS is hardened to make it very
difficult for an attacker to compromise applications. However, it is impossible 
to prevent every vulnerability. If an attacker compromises an application,
**Oz** can help to protect the computer and the user's sensitive files against
further compromise.

**Oz** can provide the following protections to sandboxed applications:

* Restrict the files that the application has access to
* Restrict network access
* Restrict audio playback 
* Restrict the system calls the application can make (using **seccomp**)
* Restrict malicious interactions between X11 applications (using **xpra**)

Each sandboxed application has its own policies to restrict its capabilities.

The following table shows some of the sandbox policies in Subgraph OS:

Application    Category           Network?    Audio?
-----------   --------           --------    ------
Tor Browser    Browser            Proxy port  Yes
Icedove	       Email client       Proxy port  No
CoyIM          Instant messager   Proxy port  No
Ricochet       Instant messager   Proxy port  No
Hexchat	       IRC client         Proxy port  No
OnionShare     File sharing       Proxy port  No
VLC            Video player       No          Yes
LibreOffice    Office suite       No          No
Evince         PDF reader         No          No
Eog            Image Viewer       No          No

**Oz** also sandboxes desktop applications from each other. Normally, 
applications running under the X11 display server can interact with each other. 
This means that one application can intercept or inject events into another 
application.

Without **Oz** or an alternate display server, there is no way to securely 
prevent applications from interacting with each other. An attacker could abuse 
this to perform malicious actions such as intercepting the keystrokes from 
another desktop application. To prevent these attacks, **Oz** sandboxes use 
**xpra** to render applications on the desktop. **Xpra** isolates applications 
by using a separate display server to render each application. Since the 
applications do not share the same display server, they cannot interact.

following page:

### Enabling an Oz profile

**Oz** profiles can be found in the following directory:
```
/var/lib/oz/cells.d
```

**Oz** automatically enables profiles in this directory. However, if you need to
manually enable a profile, you can do so by running the **oz-setup** command to
*install* the profile. 

The following example installs the profile for **evince**:
```{.bash}
$ sudo oz-setup install evince
```

When the profile is installed, **Oz** will *divert* the path of the program
executable. Instead of the program running directly, diverting it lets **Oz** 
start the program. So the next time it is started, the program will be sandboxed 
by **Oz**.

### Disabling an Oz profile

If you want to run a previously sandboxed program outside of the sandbox, you
must disable its profile. To disable a profile, run the **oz-setup** command 
with the *remove* option.

The following example removes the profile for **evince**:
```{.bash}
$ sudo oz-setup remove evince
```

When the profile is removed, **Oz** will undo the *divert* of the program path.
The program will not run in the **Oz** sandbox the next time it is started.

### Viewing the status of an Oz profile

The status of a program can also be viewed with the **oz-setup** command.

The following example shows the status of **evince**:
```{.bash}
$ sudo oz-setup status /usr/bin/evince
```

The command prints the following when **evince** profile is installed:
```
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/evince
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/evince-thumbnailer
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/evince-previewer
```

When the **evince** profile is not installed, the command prints the following:
```
Package divert is not installed for: /usr/bin/evince
Package divert is not installed for: /usr/bin/evince-thumbnailer
Package divert is not installed for: /usr/bin/evince-previewer
```

### Creating an Oz profile

In this section, we will walk through some of the options in a basic profile.

**Oz** profiles are written in JSON.

The following is the **Oz** profile for the **eog** image viewer:
```{.javascript}
{
 "name": "eog"
 , "path": "/usr/bin/eog"
 , "allow_files": true
 , "xserver": {
         "enabled": true
         , "enable_tray": false
         , "tray_icon":"/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/eog.svg"
 }
 , "networking":{
         "type":"empty"
 }
 , "whitelist": [
         {"path":"/var/lib/oz/cells.d/eog-whitelist.seccomp", "read_only": true}
 ]
 , "blacklist": [
 ]
 , "environment": [
         {"name":"GTK_THEME", "value":"Adwaita:dark"}
         , {"name":"GTK2_RC_FILES",
"value":"/usr/share/themes/Darklooks/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"}
 ]
 , "seccomp": {
         "mode":"whitelist"
         , "enforce": true
         , "whitelist":"/var/lib/oz/cells.d/eog-whitelist.seccomp"
 }
 }
```

> **Example Oz profile configuration options**
>
> *name*: The name of the profile
>
> *path*: The path to the program executable
>
> *allow_files*: Allow files to be passed as arguments to the program (such as
> image files for **eog**)
>
> *xserver -> enabled*: Enable the use of the Xserver (**xpra**)
>
> *xserver -> enable_tray*: Enable the **xpra** diagnostic tray (defaults to
> `false`, enabling it requires extra software)
>
> *xserver -> tray_icon*: The path to the tray icon
>
> *networking -> type*: The networking configuration type, *empty* disables
> networking entirely
>
> *whitelist -> path*: The path of a file to add to the sandbox, in this case it
> is the *seccomp whitelist* for **eog**
>
> *whitelist -> path -> read_only*: Whether or not the allowed file is
> *read-only*, should be *true* in most cases
>
> *blacklist*: Removes access to a file in the sandbox, accepts the *path*
> argument
>
> *environment -> name, value*: Adds environment variables by name and value to
> the sandbox
>
> *seccomp -> mode*: Adds a seccomp policy (either *whitelist* or *blacklist*) 
> to the sandbox
>
> *seccomp -> enforce*": The seccomp enforcement mode
>
> *seccomp -> whitelist*: The path to the whitelist policy

**Oz** supports a number of different profile configurations. More examples for 
real applications are located in the profiles directory:
```
/var/lib/oz/cells.d
```

### Securing system calls with seccomp in Oz

*Seccomp* is a feature of the Linux kernel to limit exposed system calls. As
system calls provide a user interface to the kernel, they expose it to attacks.
These attacks can let an attacker elevate their privileges on the computer. The
**Oz** sandbox uses *seccomp* to protect against this type of attack.

**Oz** supports *seccomp* policies on a per-application basis. *Seccomp* kills
applications whenever they violate a policy. This protects the computer in cases
where an attacker tries to exploit a vulnerability in the kernel that depends on 
the blocked system call. 

Some attacks also use system calls as part of their *payload*. A *payload* is 
the malicious code that runs as a result of a successful exploit. The *seccomp* 
policies in **Oz** can prevent *payloads* from running if they use a blocked 
system call.

**Oz** supports **whitelist** or **blacklist** policies. Whitelist policies are 
*default deny*. This means that only system calls that are explicitly permitted 
will be allowed. All other system calls (those not on the **whitelist**) cause 
the application to be killed. 

**Blacklist** policies are *default allow*. This means that seccomp blocks system
calls in the blacklist policy but allows all others (those not on the
**blacklist**). 

**Whitelist** policies are appropriate when the application is well understood.
By well understood, we mean that the behavior of the application is predictable
enough to create a precise profile of allowed system calls. This is more secure
than a **blacklist** because known behavior of the application is allowed but
unknown behavior is blocked. The disadvantage of this approach is that the
**whitelists** must be updated regularly to reflect the known behavior of the
application.

**Blacklist** policies are appropriate for applications that are not as well
understood. We use them prior to the creation of a **whitelist** or if there is
some other reason a **whitelist** cannot be created. 

**Oz** includes a generic **blacklist** that will work out-of-the-box with many 
applications. This policy blocks unusual or exotic system calls that 
applications do not normally use.

The **Oz** generic **blacklist** is located here:
```
/var/lib/oz/cells.d/generic-blacklist.seccomp
```

In Subgraph OS, we try to create **whitelist** policies for all of our supported
applications.

See the Appendix for a complete list of system calls in Subgraph OS. You can use
this reference to look up system call numbers when writing or debugging
*seccomp* policies.

### Profiling applications with oz-seccomp-tracer

**Oz** includes a tool to help with the creation and maintenance of seccomp
**whitelists**. The **oz-seccomp-tracer** profiles applications as they run to
determine the system calls that they use. This tool will generate a seccomp
`whitelist` after it exits.  

To profile Firefox using **oz-seccomp-tracer**, run the following command:
```{.bash}
$ oz-seccomp-tracer -trace -output firefox-whitelist.seccomp /usr/bin/firefox \ 
2>firefox_syscalls.txt
```

You can then use Firefox as you normally would. When you are finished, a seccomp
**whitelist** will be saved to **firefox-whitelist.seccomp**. 
**oz-seccomp-tracer** prints all of the system calls from the application to 
**stdout**. So we also advise you to redirect this output to a separate file. 
We use **firefox_syscalls.txt** in this example. You could also redirect this 
output to **/dev/null** if you don't want to save it.

### Adding a seccomp policy to an Oz application profile

Once you are satisfied with the **whitelist**, you can copy it to the following
directory:
```
/var/lib/oz/cells.d
```
Using Firefox as an example, the following snippets from
*/var/lib/oz/cells.d/firefox.json* show how to apply the policy.

First, the seccomp policy file must be added to the list of files allowed in
the sandbox:
```{.javascript}
"whitelist": [
        , {"path":"/var/lib/oz/cells.d/firefox-whitelist.seccomp", 
                "read_only": true}
]
```

Then the seccomp policy needs to be enabled to run in *enforce* mode:
```{.javascript}
"seccomp": {
         "mode":"whitelist"
         ,
"whitelist":"/var/lib/oz/cells.d/firefox-whitelist.seccomp"
         , "enforce": true
}
```

Lastly, the **Oz** daemon must be restarted to load the seccomp policy. You
should save your work at this point as restarting **Oz** will close all of the 
open sandboxes. To restart the **Oz** daemon, run the following command:
```{.bash}
$ sudo systemctl restart oz-daemon.service 
```
