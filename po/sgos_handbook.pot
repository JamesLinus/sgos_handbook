"> *What is a Tor hidden service?*\n"
">\n"
"> Tor hidden services provides a means of hosting services on the Tor "
"network.\n"
"> Any type of network service may be hosted as a hidden service (such as "
"web\n"
"> servers, file shares, and instant messaging servers).\n"
">\n"
"> Instead of using an IP address or domain name, Tor hidden services are\n"
"> accessed by their *.onion* address. The *.onion* address is an "
"automatically \n"
"> generated name that is derived from the public key of the hidden "
"service. \n"
">\n"
"> *.onion* addresses are only accessible over Tor. **Tor Browser** is one "
"way to \n"
"> access *.onion* addresses. In Subgraph OS, any application can access "
"*.onion*\n"
"> addresses because all applications are routed through Tor.  \n"
"> \n"
"> Tor hidden services provide privacy and anonymity for both the server and "
"the \n"
"> client. Tor hidden services have the following benefits over\n"
"> regular network services:\n"
">\n"
"> 1. Neither the client nor the server need to know the network location "
"(IP\n"
">    address) of each other. Tor routes traffic through a series of "
"rendezvous\n"
">    points that hide the client IP address from the server. The server's\n"
">    network location (IP address) is also hidden from the client, who "
"connects\n"
">    to the *.onion* address of the server.\n"
"> 2. All traffic between the client and server is end-to-end "
"encrypted. Traffic\n"
">    never leaves the Tor network, meaning that it is only decrypted on "
"either\n"
">    end of the transaction. When Tor is used to connect to the regular\n"
">    Internet, traffic is only encrypted until the *exit-node*. Without "
"using\n"
">    another layer of encryption such as HTTPS, exit nodes can observe "
"traffic.\n"
">    Tor hidden services are not affected by this limitation.\n"
">\n"
